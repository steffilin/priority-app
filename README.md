# priority-app
An app to automatically prioritize tasks.


CURRENT FUNCTIONS
--------------

This app lets users input tasks with a title, due date, and description (optional). The app automatically prioritizes these tasks for the user based on due date. Higher opacity indicates greater importance. Tasks can be edited once they are created by clicking on them in the home screen. After edits are made, click the "Save" button and it will bring you back to the home screen with the new task. Once the user has completed the task, they can check it off by clicking on the checkbox next to each task. And once the user has decided that they no longer want to see the task on their list, they can swipe left to delete the task entirely.
