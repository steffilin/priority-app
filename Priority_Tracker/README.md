An app to automatically prioritize tasks.

***App is still in progress***

INTRODUCTION
--------------

This app lets users input tasks with a title, due date, and description (optional). The app automatically prioritizes these tasks for the user, but the user will still be able to change the order of the tasks to their desired order (this is to account for the case when a user thinks that a specific task is more important than another even though it may be "due" at a later day.
